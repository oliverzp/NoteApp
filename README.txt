Totes Notes - A Simple Note Taking App

======================================

This simple note taking app lets you type short post-its into your browser. You can orgranize your post-its by color. To cycle colors simply hit the Edit button, then the color wheel button for the corresponding post-it note.

Content is saved into localStorage until your next session for continuous usage.

This app was built using AngularJS. Each post-it is a directive. See comments in source.
